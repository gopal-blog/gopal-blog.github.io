# Leetcode 2108.Find First Palindromic String in the Array

## Problem Statement : 
```
Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
```
## Examples :

### Example 1
```
Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
```
### Example 3
```
Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```

## Constrains : 
```
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
```
## Explanation
```
  1. First instinct should be to create a loop to fetch every word in words array
  2. Compare word's reverse to the actual word.
  3. IF that's the case return word else return ""(Empty String)
```

## Solution (Py3) : 
``` python
  class Solution:
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        for word in words:
            if word == word[::-1]:
                return word
        return ""
```
