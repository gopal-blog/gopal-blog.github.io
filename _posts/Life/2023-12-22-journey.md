# Journey from Dumraon to Bangalore: Navigating the Tech Landscape in College

## Year 1 :

In my first year at the bustling city of Bangalore, I carried dreams of becoming a software developer, a passion ignited during low-level computer classes in 8th grade. The transition from the quaint town of Dumraon near the Ganges to this high-tech hub marked the beginning of my engineering adventure. With a Nokia N95 in hand, I delved into the world of the internet, a precursor to the tech-driven path that lay ahead.

Amid the initial chaos of a new city and college life, friendships blossomed. From hanging out to bunking classes, my college days were filled with camaraderie. One key figure emerged early on â€“ Dev, a friend made on the very first day.

Stay tuned for the next chapter of my college journey, where the foundation for my tech aspirations takes root.
