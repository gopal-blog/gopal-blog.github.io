Central to the design is the striking 23’x17’ verandah and its mirrored balcony above, which connect the home’s key spaces, such as the living room, dining area, kitchen, and bedrooms with large sliding doors that offer uninterrupted views of the garden. Additionally, these transitional spaces serve as the heart of the house. Thus, fostering family gatherings and an intimate connection with nature.

The formal living and dining areas come together to form a grand central hall, serving as the heart of the home and the epicenter for public interaction. This space acts as a gateway, seamlessly connecting to other rooms, including the grand kitchen. The kitchen is thoughtfully designed for both functionality and accessibility. Additionally, it opens to the garden through sliding doors, linking directly to the verandah. This connection allows for a smooth transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. Thus, making it effortless to enjoy meals in the serene outdoor setting. Additionally, all public and private areas are thoughtfully interlinked through passages, offering easy access to the verandah and balcony, enhancing the sense of openness and a constant connection to the greenery.

Concept

The inspiration for this project stems from the timeless principles of modernist architecture, particularly the seamless integration of indoor and outdoor spaces as championed by architectural maestros like Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier.



Drawing from their philosophy of harmonizing built structures with nature, this project adopts an open-plan layout and expansive glazing to blur the boundaries between the interior spaces and the lush garden outside.



The L-shaped design, with verandahs and balconies strategically layered, takes cues from vernacular Indian architecture, reinterpreted in a contemporary style.



Material

The focus on materiality, with granite, textured finishes, and aluminum panels, reflects a commitment to creating spaces that are both enduring and contextually grounded, paying homage to architectural traditions while embracing modern minimalism.
