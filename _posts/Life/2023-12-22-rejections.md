## Year 4 - Continued:

As the curtain fell on my college journey, the pursuit of my first job came with its share of challenges and rejections. Among the memorable setbacks, the rejection from Mindtree for the role of Junior Dev stood out. Despite navigating through the initial screening, aptitude, and coding rounds successfully, a group discussion on politics took an unexpected turn. Despite my effort to engage in a topic of general interest, the outcome was rejection. The sting of this rejection lingered, prompting a period of introspection and sulking that, unbeknownst to me, would turn out to be a blessing in disguise in the years to come.

Another significant blow came from Flock, where I progressed through coding rounds and on-campus interviews, only to be tripped up by an essay writing round. The pain of falling short in this final stretch echoed, leaving me grappling with the disappointment.

Undeterred, I pressed on, navigating through the intricacies of job interviews. Amazon, in the role of DevOps, presented its own set of challenges. I cleared multiple rounds, showcasing proficiency in aptitude, Linux, and SQL. Yet, the journey was far from over, as the elusive quest for the right fit continued.

Join me in the next chapter as I navigate through the landscape of rejections, resilience, and the ultimate triumph that awaits on the path to securing my first job.
