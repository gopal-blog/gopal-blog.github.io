# Journey Contd....

## Year 4 :


In the final stretch of my college journey, a pivotal moment unfolded as my father fulfilled a cherished wish â€“ gifting me the latest MacBook Air. This gesture ignited a newfound passion for machine learning, prompting a deep dive into its intricacies. Armed with my sleek new laptop, I delved into the theoretical foundations, unraveling the inner workings of models.

Driven by aspiration, I embarked on a project that transcended my prior achievements. I trained a model with the goal of predicting problem areas in X-rays/MRIs, a venture that would consume the entirety of my seventh semester. The ambition reached its zenith as I envisioned presenting this groundbreaking project in front of the head of ISRO, culminating in the publication of a paper that would mark a milestone in my academic journey.

Simultaneously, I undertook exams like CoCubes, securing an impressive percentile above 90. This achievement translated into a flurry of interview opportunities. While some interviews proved elusive in the final rounds, a couple of offers materialized. However, discerning about my aspirations, I made the bold choice to decline these offers, holding out for a position that resonated more closely with my ambitions.
