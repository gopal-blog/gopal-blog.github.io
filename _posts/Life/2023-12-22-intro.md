# ** Intro .. **

From the small town of Dumraon near the Ganges to the tech hub of Bangalore, my journey has been a tapestry of dreams, setbacks, and triumphs. Envisioning myself as a software developer since my early encounters with computers, the desire to share my experiences and insights led me to the aspiration of starting a blog website.

My years in engineering college served as the crucible where my technical acumen took root. Amid the vibrant atmosphere of Bangalore, I navigated the intricacies of Linux, web development, data structures, and algorithms, albeit at a surface level. The initial years were marked by friendships, setbacks, and unexpected turns, paving the way for resilience and determination.

In this narrative, I'll unfold the chapters of my college journey, the trials of post-graduation job hunting, the rejections that shaped my path, and the ultimate triumph of securing a role at Paytm. From QA engineer to delving into coding, each step has been a revelation, and the story continues to evolve.

And so, the journey beginsâ€”a tale of aspirations, challenges, and the pursuit of knowledge, with the dream of a blog website always in my heart.
