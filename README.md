## README

This repository contains the source code and content for a personal blog website built with Jekyll. If you are interested in exploring or contributing to this project, this README will help you navigate through the files and understand the structure of the repository.

## About

The blog website, hosted at [gopal-blog.github.io](https://gopal-blog.github.io), is a platform where I write about the latest technologies I am learning. The topics cover a range of subjects including Python, Go, AWS Deployment, and the exploration of new futuristic projects. These projects include a music app, a dating site, and a local tourism site. The blog serves as a space to share insights, tutorials, and experiences in these domains as I delve into the exciting world of technology and innovation.


## Repository Contents

### 1. `_posts` Directory

The `_posts` directory contains individual blog posts written in Markdown format. Each file represents a single blog post and follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. This is where you can find the actual content of the blog.

### 2. `_layouts` Directory

The `_layouts` directory contains the layout templates for different pages on the website. These templates define the structure and formatting of pages such as the home page, blog post page, etc.

### 3. `_includes` Directory

The `_includes` directory contains reusable components or snippets that are included in the layout templates. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to maintain the codebase.

### 4. `assets` Directory

The `assets` directory includes static assets such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files used in the website. This is where you can find and manage resources related to the site's aesthetics and functionality.

### 5. `_config.yml`

The `_config.yml` file holds configuration settings for the Jekyll site. It includes information such as site title, description, and other settings related to the blog.

### 6. Other Files

Other files and directories in the root of the repository may include additional configuration files, scripts, or documentation related to the project.
